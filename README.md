#  A tiny, no-nonsense password manager for terminal lovers.

I live in the terminal — it's my main workspace.  
But every time I need a password, I have to leave it, dig through some manager or note, copy it, then come back and paste it here. That breaks my flow.

## 🤔 Why?

Because switching windows to grab a password is annoying.  
This manager keeps things inside the terminal, where everything belongs.

## ✨ What it does

- Save your passwords (encrypted, of course)
- Show them in the terminal
- Copy them directly to your clipboard
- No fluff, no UI — just pure CLI goodness

## 🛠️ Status

Still in progress, but it works well for daily use.  
Use it. Break it. Improve it. 😄
